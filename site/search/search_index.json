After a lot of thought and research, I decided to get the Prusa i3 mk2. After about a year of printing the mk2s came out which was faster, quieter and produced higher quality prints than the mk2 so I decided to get the upgrade kit. Unfortunately since Prusa ships from the Czech Republic and has a significant lead time it took about two months for the upgrade to come. Soon after I received the upgrade they released the mk3 which was a totally redesigned mk2 with a removable bed, 24v power supply, Rambo einsy, etc. after a few months of good reviews for the mk3 I decided to upgrade to the mk3 and it was a way better experience than the mk2. Octoprint \u00b6 After using an sd card and taking it in and out of the printer, I decided to use Octoprint. Octoprint is a web interface for 3D printers that allows you to control and monitor all aspects of the printer and print jobs right from your browser. Octoprint is made to be run on a small Linux board, I chose to run it on a Raspberry Pi 3. The pi 3 is the fastest pi allowing the web interface to be very snappy. Anti-Vibration feet \u00b6 3d printing at a reasonable speed can be quite loud because of the vibrations created by the motors. To solve this issue I printed anti-vibration feet which bend to compensate for the vibrations of the printer and ended up significantly reducing the amount of noise created by the printer.","title":"3D Printing"},{"location":"3d-Printing/#3d-printing","text":"Ever since I was introduced to 3d printing I was amazed by how I can turn plastic filament into whatever I could fit in the print bed.

About Our Team \u00b6 We are Robostorm FTC Team 12601 from Hunterdon County New Jersey. We are a 4H club which means we are open to all kids in Hunterdon county grades 7-12. Being a small team allows us to have more hands-on time with the robot. 2019 Season - FIRST Rover Ruckus \u00b6 My second year doing FTC, this year we only have 4 team members. Check back on first launch September 8th for more info. 2018 Season - FIRST Relic Recovery \u00b6 Our first year as a rookie FTC team, we were one of the smallest teams with only 8 members. When we started we hoped we could make it past the first few competitions and somehow we ended up in worlds. Unlike other teams, our robot was custom machined by one of our team members in his machine shop. When we got to our first competition we realized that we were one of the only robots that could actually move and it stayed that way until we got to qualifiers. Awards \u00b6 Central StartUp: Winning Alliance, Highest Scoring Alliance, Audacious Autonomous, Alliance Captain with the Highest RPs. Havoc on Hudson: Winning Alliance, Highest Scoring Alliance, Alliance Captain with Highest RPs, Audacious Autonomous. Winter\u2019s Edge: Winning Alliance, Audacious Autonomous, Highest Points by an Alliance in a Match, Outstanding Performance by a Rookie Team.
