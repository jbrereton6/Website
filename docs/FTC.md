The FIRST Tech Challenge is a robotics competition where students compete head to head in a team environment.  Teams are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots.

##About Our Team
![Team Picture](\img\Team-Picture_2019-2020.jpg)

We are Robostorm FTC Team 12601 from Hunterdon County New Jersey.  We are part of a 4H club which means we are open to anyone in Hunterdon county grades 7-12.  Being a small team allows us to have more hands-on time with the robot.

##2018-2019 Season - FIRST Rover Ruckus
After a very successful first year, we were determined to do even better in our second year.  We knew it would be a challenge because three of our members graduated high school, making us a team of 5, we had lost both our lead mechanical and lead programmer.  Following several competitions, we were thrilled to qualify for States.  Between the qualifier and States, we made various modifications to our robot, some of which malfunctioned at States.  We did not qualify for Worlds, but we learned what we had to do differently and knew what adjustments we had to make for the 2019-2020 season.

##2017-2018 Season - FIRST Relic Recovery
The 2017-2018 season was our first year as an FTC team.  Not only were we a rookie team, but we were also one of the smallest teams with only 8 members.  One of our members owned a CNC machine enabling us to machine our robot out of aluminum, giving us a large advantage over other robots.  Within weeks we had a great robot that was able to score in all the point categories.  We won our first few competitions and qualified for New Jersey State championships.  From there we qualified to North Eastern Super Regionals and continued to the World Championship in Detroit, Michigan.
