##About FIRST Tech Challenge
The FIRST Tech Challenge is a robotics competition that allows students to compete head to head, and are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots.

##About Our Team
We are Robostorm FTC Team 12601 from Hunterdon County new Jersey.  We are a 4H club witch means we are open to all kids in Hunterdon county grades 7-12.  Being a small team allows us to have more hands on time with the robot.
