Due to COVID-19 hospitals around the world have been struggling with a lack of medical supplies.  In response to this virus and shortage and supplies, I have been printing and assembling face shields to be worn over respirators.  Medical professionals are in great need of both respirators and face shields, however, respirators are not easily 3d printable and if printed are not very protective.  Face shields, however, are 3d printable and are in equal demand, they protect medical professional's eyes and face when treating an infected patient.  I can print about eight per day and have been donating them to a local hospital.  At this time many hospitals are forced to reuse face shields and respirators multiple times, and this design allows the shield to be taken apart and properly disinfected.
