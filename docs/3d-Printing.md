Ever since I was introduced to 3d printing I was amazed by how I can turn plastic filament into whatever I could fit in the print bed.  After a lot of thought and research, I decided to purchase the Prusa i3 Mk2.  Since then I have upgraded to the Prusa i3 Mk3

Shortly after purchasing my printer I discovered Octoprint.  Octoprint is a web interface for 3D printers that allows the user to control and monitor all aspects of their printer and print jobs right from their browser.  This allows me to remotely monitor and controll my printer, which was especially useful for monitoring long prints.
