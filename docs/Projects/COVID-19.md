Due to the COVID-19 pandemic hospitals around the world are struggling with a lack of medical supplies.  Medical professionals are in great need of both respirators and face shields.  Respirators are not easily 3d printable and if printed are not very protective.  Face shields, however, are 3d printable and are in equal demand, they protect medical professional's eyes and face when treating an infected patient.  In response to this shortage of supplies, I am printing and assembling face shields to be worn over respirators.  I print about eight per day and donate them to a local hospital.  Many hospitals are forced to reuse face shields and respirators multiple times, the benefit of the design I am using is that it allows the shield to be taken apart and properly disinfected for re-use.
