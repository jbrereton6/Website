##About Our Team
![Team Picture](img\Team-Picture.jpg)

We are Robostorm FTC Team 12601 from Hunterdon County New Jersey.  We are a 4H club which means we are open to all kids in Hunterdon county grades 7-12.  Being a small team allows us to have more hands-on time with the robot.

##2019 Season - FIRST Rover Ruckus
My second year doing FTC, this year our team has shrunk to only five members due to members graduating.  We had lost both our lead mechanical and lead programmer and knew it would be a difficult season.  We decided to buy a CNC machine to machine our driveplates for our robot, however the machine we bought was not nearly powerfull enough to machine the aluminum the way we needed it.  We decided to outsorce our driveplates to a local machine shop and they were much better.

###Awards

##2018 Season - FIRST Relic Recovery
![Team Picture](img\Team-Picture.jpg)
Our first year as a rookie FTC team, we were one of the smallest teams with only 8 members.  When we started we hoped we could make it past the first few competitions and somehow we ended up in worlds.  Unlike other teams, our robot was custom machined by one of our team members in his machine shop.  When we got to our first competition we realized that we were one of the only robots that could actually move and it stayed that way until we got to qualifiers.
