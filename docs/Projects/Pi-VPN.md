#Raspberry Pi VPN

![VPN Diagram](img\VPN.jpg)

A Virtual private network or VPN creates a virtual encrypted tunnel between you and a remote server.  I used an open source VPN server software called OpenVPN to run my own VPN off a raspberry pi 3.  I decided to run my own VPN because I have complete control over the network I am connected to and I can access all the devices on my home network.
