##What is a CNC Machine
Computer numerical control (CNC) is programmed code that represents instructions for precise movements to be carried out by machines.  This code defines how to automatically create, produce, or transform a virtual object into a real one.  A CNC machine is a machine that executes this code.  CNC milling is used in many different cases including making metal car parts and aerospace components.

##My CNC
For my CNC I decided to build one from scratch, there were many kits avalible online but they were all either missing important features or extremely pricey.  For the design I modified [Nikodem Bartnik's 3D printed DIY CNC](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3004773).  I chose this design because it seemed very reliable, space effecient and incorporated 3D printed parts, however like many of the kits online it was missing a few important features.  To compensate for this I modified his design to include limit switches, a vacuum system and a better spindle.
