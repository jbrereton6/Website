A travel router is a form of network router that connects to a pre-routed network such as a hotel's Wi-Fi and provides the user with a more secure private network.  A travel router is also very useful for IoT devices that are unable to connect to a network with a captive portal.

##Hardware


##Software
For my DIY travel router, I used OpenWrt, a lightweight Linux operating system for routers that can run on almost any device.  OpenWrt is fully open source and takes up very little storage space by using an advanced package system that allows for full customizability.
