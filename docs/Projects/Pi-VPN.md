A Virtual private network or VPN creates a virtual encrypted tunnel between you and a remote server.  I used an open-source VPN server software called OpenVPN to run my VPN off a [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://amzn.to/2PQSVmL "Raspberry Pi 3 B+").  Hosting my VPN allows me to connect to devices on my home network from anywhere in the world.
