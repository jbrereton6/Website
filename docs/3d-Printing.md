#3D Printing

Ever since I was introduced to 3d printing I was amazed by how I can turn plastic filament into whatever I could fit in the print bed.  After a lot of thought and research I decided to get the Prusa i3 mk2.  After about a year of printing the mk2s came out which was faster, quieter and produced higher quality prints than the mk2 so I decided to get the upgrade kit.  Unfortunately since Prusa ships from the Czech Republic and has a significant lead time it took about two months for the upgrade to come.  Soon after I received the upgrade they released the mk3 which was a totally redesigned mk2 with a removable bed, 24v power supply, rambo einsy, etc. after a few months of good reviews for the mk3 I decided to upgrade to the mk3 and it was a way better experience than the mk2.
##Octoprint

After using an sd card and taking it in and out of the printer, I decided to use Octoprint.  Octoprint is a web interface for 3D printers that allows you to control and monitor all aspects of the printer and print jobs right from your browser.  Octoprint is made to be run on a small Linux board, I chose to run it on a Raspberry Pi 3.  The pi 3 is the fastest pi allowing the web interface to be very snappy.
##Anti-Vibration feet

3d printing at a reasonable speed can be quite loud because of the vibrations created by the motors.  To solve this issue I printed anti-vibration feet which bend to compensate for the vibrations of the printer and ended up significantly reducing the amount of noise created by the printer.
