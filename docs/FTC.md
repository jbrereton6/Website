##About FIRST Tech Challenge
The FIRST Tech Challenge is a robotics competition that allows students to compete head to head, and are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots.

##About Our Team
We are Robostorm FTC Team 12601 from Hunterdon County new Jersey.  We are a 4H club witch means we are open to all kids in Hunterdon county grades 7-12.  Being a small team allows us to have more hands on time with the robot.

##2019 Season - FIRST Rover Ruckus
My second year doing FTC, this year we only have 4 team members

##2018 Season - FIRST Relic Recovery
Our fist year as a rookie FTC team, we were one of the smallest teams with only 8 members.  When we started we hoped we could make it past the first few competitions and some how ended up in worlds.  Unlike other teams our robot was custom machined by one of our team members in his machine shop.  When we got to our first competition we realized that we were one of the only robots that could actually move and it stayed that way until we got to qualifiers.
