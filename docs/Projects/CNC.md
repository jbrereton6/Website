##What is a CNC Machine
Computer numerical control (CNC) is code that represents instructions for precise movements to be carried out by machines.  This code defines how to automatically create, produce, or transform a virtual object into a real one.  A CNC machine is a machine that executes this code.  CNC milling is used in many different cases including making metal car parts and aerospace components.

##My CNC
For my CNC I decided to build one from scratch, there were many kits available online but they were all either missing important features or extremely pricey.  For the design, I modified [Nikodem Bartnik's 3D printed DIY CNC](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3004773).  I chose this design because it seemed very reliable, space-efficient and incorporated 3D printed parts, however like many of the kits online it was missing a few important features.  To compensate for this I modified his design to include limit switches, a vacuum system, and a better spindle.

##Future changes and improvements
Similar to many of my other projects I am constantly modifying and improving my CNC.  Some improvements I plan to make in the future are lengthening the z-axis, creating guards for the linear rails to prevent dust and debris from getting jammed in the rails, and adding a self-leveling z-probe.
