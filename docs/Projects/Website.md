##Domain
This website uses Google domains a domain registration service offered by Google.

##Hosting
For hosting, I used a [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://amzn.to/2PQSVmL "Raspberry Pi 3 B+"), my original plan was to use digital ocean, a cloud computing company, but I chose the raspberry pi because it allows me to have full controll of my web server and everything on it and is a one time purchase rather than monthly payments.

##Design
I designed this website using the [MkDocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme based off Google's material design.  I chose to use MkDocs because they have tons of great themes that I can edit to better fit my website.  I also used Disqus a comment hosting service to assist people on recreating my projects.
