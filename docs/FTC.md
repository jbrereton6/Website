##About Our Team
![Team Picture](\img\Team-Picture_2019-2020.jpg)

We are Robostorm FTC Team 12601 from Hunterdon County New Jersey.  We are a 4H club which means we are open to anyone in Hunterdon county grades 7-12.  Being a small team allows us to have more hands-on time with the robot.

##2018-2019 Season - FIRST Rover Ruckus
After a very sucessful first year we were determined to do even better our second, however three of our members were seniors and graduated high school, making us a team of 5.  We had lost both our lead mechanical and lead programmer and knew it would be a difficult season.  We decided to buy a CNC machine to machine various parts of our robot.  Due to extra time spent making parts with our CNC we started building our robot later into the season, with less time to have it built.  We did great at our first few competitions and qualified for states, however between the qualifier and states we made various modifications to our robot, some of which ended up malfunctioning at states.  We were not able to qualify for worlds, but we deffinetly leared what we had to do differently and knew what adjustments we had to make for next year.

##2017-2018 Season - FIRST Relic Recovery
Our first year as a rookie FTC team, we were one of the smallest teams with only 8 members.  At the beginning of the season we doubted we would make it to states, being a rookie team with little FTC experience.  One of our members owned a CNC and was able to help us machine our robot out of aluminum, giving us a large advantage over other robots.  Within weeks we had a great robot that was able to score in all the point catigories.  We won our first few competitions and qualified for New Jersey state championships.  From there we qualified to North Eastern Super regionals and continued to the world championship in detroit.  In conclusion our first year in FTC was a very sucessful and unexpected year.
