##Domain
This website uses Google domains a domain registration service offered by Google.

##Hosting
For hosting, I used a raspberry pi 3 model b+ my original plan was to use digital ocean a cloud computing company, but I chose the raspberry pi because I own my server and everything on it and I have absolute control over the server.

##Design
I designed this website using the MkDocs material theme based off Google's material design.  I chose to use MkDocs because they have tons of great themes that I can edit to better fit my website.  I also used disquis a commenting service for websites to assist people on recreating my projects.
